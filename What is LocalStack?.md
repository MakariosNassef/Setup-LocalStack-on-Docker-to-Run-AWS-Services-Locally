# Setup-LocalStack-on-Docker-to-Run-AWS-Services-Locally.

### What is LocalStack?

LocalStack provides an easy-to-use test/mocking framework for developing Cloud applications. It spins up a testing environment on your local machine that provides the same functionality and APIs as the real AWS cloud environment.
without ever talking to the cloud.

### What is it for?
to develop in an environment that is minimally similar (ideally the same) to the one where the application will run. Those who develop for the AWS environment do not always have an AWS account available or, even when they do, they cannot manipulate resources with great freedom due to the security of the corporate environment.

So, with AWS Localstack we can test our features at development time without having to consume the resources of an AWS account.

### Advantages
You save time and money to perform functional testing of our features in a local environment.
